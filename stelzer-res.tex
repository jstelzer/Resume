            across 4 TB of data.  Software used a custom distributed
            processing engine to implement fuzzy matching algorithms
            that ranged from simplistic fuzzy matching
            (e.g. Levenshtein edit distance) to complex multi-step
            criteria. }

            address standardization/geocoding service as a centralized
            service for core HMS applications.}

          \ressubitem{Created and designed software to facilitate
            moving from a large, legacy code base to a more granular
            SOA architecture composed of loosely coupled applications
            such that components could be reused and shared across
            applications.}

            in C/C++ that called into the J2EE stack via IIOP.}

          \ressubitem{Created web services layer to facilitate
            interoperability between different technology stacks
            (ruby, java, perl).}
