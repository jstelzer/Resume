\begin{objsection}{Objective}          
I am a software developer with a strong background developing in a Unix environment (Linux/Solaris, specifically). I believe that the proper application of open source technologies along side COTS software is the optimal path for creating applications/infrastructure. I have a well-rounded background as both a systems administrator and a developer. I believe this helps over all system design. I am looking for a forward thinking company where I can help the business by enhancing existing systems and building new, scalable solutions as we identify future business needs.
